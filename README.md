# Getting Started
## Installing Dependencies
## Virtual Enviornment
I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. 

## PIP Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is setup and running, install dependencies by navigating to the working project directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Running the local server 

From within the directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
